This repository provides information and knowledge regarding the ongoing progress, evolution, and development of our self-driving robot vehicle, which was created and coded by us, Salmane Derdeb and Taha TAIDI LAAMIRI as participants in the Future Engineers 2025 division of the World Robot Olympiad (WRO).

### World Robot Olympiad (WRO)

> The World Robot Olympiad (WRO) is a prestigious international robotics competition that ignites the imaginations of students worldwide. It challenges participants to showcase their creativity, problem-solving skills, and technical prowess in designing and programming robots for a variety of tasks and challenges.
>
> One of the most dynamic categories within WRO is the Future Engineers category. Here, participants are tasked with developing innovative solutions to real-world problems using robotics and automation. This category serves as a breeding ground for future innovators, encouraging students to think critically and creatively, laying the groundwork for a new generation of engineers and technologists.
>
> This year, the Future Engineers category presents an exciting challenge: creating a self-driving car. This challenge pushes participants to explore the cutting edge of robotics, adding layers of complexity and innovation to an already thrilling competition.

# WRO Future Engineers Competition

| **1.Mobility Management**             |
|:---------------------------------------|
| Mobility management discussion should cover how the vehicle movements are managed. What motors are selected, how they are selected and implemented. A brief discussion regarding the vehicle chassis design /selection can be provided as well as the mounting of all components to the vehicle chassis/structure. The discussion may include engineering principles such as speed, torque, power etc. usage. Building or assembly instructions can be provided together with 3D CAD files to 3D print parts.|

| **2.Power and Sense Management**        |
|:---------------------------------------|
|Power and Sense management discussion should cover the power source for the vehicle as well as the sensors required to provide the vehicle with information to negotiate the different challenges. The discussion can include the reasons for selecting various sensors and how they are being used on the vehicle together with power consumption. The discussion could include a wiring diagram with BOM for the vehicle that includes all aspects of professional wiring diagrams.|

| **4.Pictures – Team and Vehicle**       |
|:---------------------------------------|
| Pictures of the team and robot must be provided. The pictures of the robot must cover all sides of the robot, must be clear, in focus and show aspects of the mobility, power and sense, and obstacle management. Reference in the discussion sections 1, 2 and 3 can be made to these pictures. Team photo is necessary for judges to relate and identify the team during the local and international competitions. |
