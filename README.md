## 🌍 World Robot Olympiad (WRO)

> The World Robot Olympiad is a global robotics competition that inspires creativity, teamwork, and technical innovation.  
>
> 🚗 In the **Future Engineers** category, students must design a **self-driving vehicle** capable of solving real-world challenges using robotics and automation.  
>
> 🧩 This year’s challenge pushes teams to the edge of innovation by asking them to develop an autonomous car using real sensors, coding logic, and intelligent decisions.
