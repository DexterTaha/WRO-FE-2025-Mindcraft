# 📘 MkDocs Documentation Site

Welcome to the source for this documentation site! It's powered by [**MkDocs**](https://www.mkdocs.org/) — a fast, simple, and beautiful static site generator that's perfect for technical and project documentation.

We use the **Material for MkDocs** theme for a clean, modern UI with tons of customization.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- `pip` package manager

Then, install MkDocs and the Material theme:

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Here’s how the repo is organized:

```
.
├── docs/               # Markdown files go here
│   ├── index.md        # Homepage (landing page)
│   └── guide.md        # Example documentation page
├── mkdocs.yml          # Main MkDocs configuration file
└── README.md           # This file
```

You’ll write your content inside the `docs/` folder using standard Markdown.

---

## 🧪 Local Development

To preview your site while editing:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This starts a local dev server at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Live reload is enabled — changes to your `.md` or `.yml` files will refresh the browser instantly.

---

## 🏗️ Build the Static Site

When you're ready to deploy or share your site, build the static version:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

The site will be generated in the `site/` folder.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### 📄 GitHub Pages (Built-in)

Deploy to GitHub Pages with a single command:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

> ⚠️ This pushes the built site to the `gh-pages` branch, so make sure your repo is initialized correctly and committed.

### 🌍 Other Hosting Options

You can host the `site/` directory on any static file host, such as:

- **Netlify** – drag & drop the `site/` folder, or connect your GitHub repo
- **Vercel** – auto-deploy from your Git repo
- **Cloudflare Pages**, **GitLab Pages**, **Firebase Hosting**, etc.

## 🎨 Theme & Configuration

We're using the excellent [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. Customize it in `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
site_name: My Project Docs

      primary: indigo
      accent: indigo
  features:
    - navigation.tabs
    - navigation.instant
    - toc.integrate
    - content.code.copy
```

You can also add:

- `extra_css` and `extra_javascript`
- `favicon` and logo
- Markdown extensions
- Plugins like search, tags, i18n, versioning

## 🔌 Recommended Plugins

Add to `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml

```

Install via pip:

## 🧪 Tips for Writing Docs

- Use `#` for page titles, `##` for sections
- Link to internal pages using `[Text](page.md)`
- Add images inside `docs/img/` and embed with Markdown:

```markdown
![Alt text](img/example.png)
```

- Use code blocks:

<pre>
\```python
def hello():
    print("Hello MkDocs!")
\```
</pre>
